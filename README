Purpose
-------
The goal is to provide a usefull, crossplatform, light and free toolset for working with regular expressions.
RXBuild is a bunch of javascripts and an html main page gluing them together.

Features
--------
- Edit the regular expression with a big font. (Yes, it's a feature!)
- Run the regular expression against sample input text during editing to check edit impact on results
- Analyse the regular expression by using the built-in regular expression to english translator
- Insert common regular expression patterns quickly
- Quick reference from Mozilla
- Create token list type regular expressions
- Escape text to a regular expression litteral (one that would match exactly that text) and insert it
- Generate various code outputs for the regular expression (Outputs C# code that would run the current expression)

Run RXBuild
-----------
Simply open regex.html in your favorite browser (or Firefox).

Platforms
---------
The code is tested only with Opera 9.6. Support for Firefox, Safari and IE7+ seems ok though.

Requirements
------------
Should be independent at runtime, however, to build, you need at least JS/CC (http://jscc.jmksf.com/).
The Makefile uses JSDoc (http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/) to build the documentation
and YUI Compressor to reduce the sources size http://www.julienlecomte.net/yuicompressor/

Compile Instructions
--------------------
There is no need to compile, unless you are editing the parser's grammar (src/regex_parser.par).
See the MakeFile. Update the paths in Makefile.user before hoping for anything.
